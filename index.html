          <p>Java is a great language because it's so ubiquitous and one of the easier ones to learn! You can use it to make just about anything, such as computer or Andriod apps, and it has some of the highest number of job prospects. Finally, because it's so popular, there's a huge amount of resources for you to draw upon and a large community for you to interact with.</p>
          <p>Might I suggest visiting the <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus website</a>? They have a Java/Android course that might interest you! There's two campuses, one in <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/seattle/">Seattle</a> and the other in <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/portland/">Portland</a>. You can even take their <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/online/">Intro to Programming course online</a>!</p>

          <p>C# tends to be used by large and established companies, which means that it's usage is relatively stable. The language is backed by Microsoft, and Microsoft has open sourced the language and surrounding platform, porting it to run on Mac and Linux, and incorporating many of the best features of other languages. Apart from all that, you can use this language to get into game development!</p>

          <h3>...You should study Ruby!</h3>
          <p>Ruby is a great language to learn because it resembles human speech, making it fairly easy to understand. With Ruby you can make interactive websites that take user info, rapidly prototype ideas, and so much more. If you learn Ruby on Rails, you can do more complex tasks, if you learn JRuby you can make Java apps, andif you learn RubyMotion you can build native iOS and even Android apps! While this language doesn't have a lot of job postings, there is still a high demand for skilled Ruby (typically Ruby on Rails) programmers. Ruby is here to stay, after all it's used by websites such as Twitter, Hulu, Airbnb, and GitHub!</p>

          <p>PHP is a great language to learn because it's used all over the place, you just can't see it like Java and C#. 80% of all websites use PHP! It can be used to develop websites, but it's generally used for servers, databases, and back-end development. Another cool thing is that PHP can be used on all major operating systems. While there are few postings for PHP jobs, you can be assured we will always need people to work with servers and maintain the back end!</p>
